# Notes for CS260

### First Assingment in GitHub
This is the beginning of my notes for this class
I learned a lot and began to use VS code. I really like the program, but I actually also really like just editing directly in github. It is really nice. I will probably write a lot of my code there, and then just test running it in VS code and that environment when applicable.

This is the startup readme file link... [readme file](https://github.com/NyiajNpis/startup/blob/main/README.md)
See if that works



Amazon AWS Notes
That is the command for logging into the server with the console
ssh -i Documents/School-Desktop/AWSDev/schoolkey.pem ubuntu@34.231.116.101

my elastic IP is 34.231.116.101

My leased domain is chatdewpt.net

chatdewpt.net
