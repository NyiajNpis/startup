Startup Application for CS 260

This is a readme file for the startup application for CS 260 Web Development Class
I am really looking forward to using different tools for this class and making a cool application


# Elevator Pitch:
## My Startup Application: Chat DewPT
### The Elevator:
College is hard, in fact **_life_** is hard. But one of the beautiful things that makes 
both of those things easier is the divine elixir known as Mtn Dew. Not only is it 
delicous and full of life giving caffeine, but it comes in a flavor fit for any mood. 
But sometimes it is hard to know where to find just the right one. Introducing 
Chat DewPT, the fastest way to find your favorite fix. Chat DewPT is a community driven 
platform where you can submit, browse, and verify vendors for all your favourite 
flavors of that delicious, bubbly brew. Users create verified accounts, submit locations 
and flavor options available there, and other users can confirm on that post that it is 
accurate. All of these submissions will be kept 
current with constant live updates so they won't EVER be sent on a wild Dew chase.

text and icons, and their arrangement. Before and after the login would technically be different pages, but it will look similar to appear cohesive](https://github.com/NyiajNpis/startup/blob/main/StartupSketch.jpg)
